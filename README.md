## Module Two Challenge
### Overview of the Project
Our client, Steve, wanted to easily find the total daily volume and the yearly return for each stock. The total daily volume is simply the total number of shares traded throughout the day, while the yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. Knowing the yearly return for all the stocks can help Steve make a decision on what stocks to buy. We've allowed Steve to find the total daily volume and yearly return of all the stocks for both the years 2017 and 2018.
### Results
After writing all the code and running the analysis on all the stocks for the years 2017 and 2018, we can conclude a few things. First, it is apparent that the yearly returns for almost all the stocks (except TERP) in 2017 were positive. In the photo below, we can see that the rows colored green all had a positve yearly return, and the one stock in red had a negative yearly return.
